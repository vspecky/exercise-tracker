# Exercise Tracker
A simple exercise tracker app made using the MERN Stack, from the [freeCodeCamp.com tutorial](https://youtu.be/7CqJlxBYj-M). Made to learn and gain a basic understanding of how to use React (I am very familiar with 
MongoDB, Express and Node.js).

I also used Typescript (tutorial uses Javascript) to gain additional working experience with Typescript.
